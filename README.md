# Vanilla-JS-music-player

A music player, have some basic controls such as pause/play, skip backward, skip forward and mute. In this, i get my songs from chillhops(a website having some cool bgm's) API. It also work's with your songs which is saved in your local machine. Just the absolute correct song path is needed.
